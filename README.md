# The Rust programming language - in Hebrew
This is a Hebrew community translation of the official Rust book.

## Building and viewing
Steps to build and view the book:

1. Install mdBook: `cargo install mdbook`
2. Start live preview servers: `mdbook serve`
3. open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

Changes to the book are immediately applied and reloaded in the browser.

If you just want to build the book, this is enough:

```bash
mdbook build
```
